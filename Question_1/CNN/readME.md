# Deep Learning for predicitng well oil production rate (WOPR) 

I decided to use CNN at first based on 3D nature of the dataset and it has a very simple structure and the error rates indicate that the model is performing well.
In the next step i was curious if LSTM can capture the pattern of ht flatten data and even though the model is sophisticated, it was not able to perform nearly as good as CNN network.
