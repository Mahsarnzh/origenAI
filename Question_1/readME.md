# Deep Learning for predicitng well oil production rate (WOPR) 

I decided to use CNN at first based on 3D nature of the dataset and it has a very simple structure and the error rates indicate that the model is performing well.
In the next step I was curious if LSTM can capture the pattern of the flatten data and even though the model is sophisticated, it was not able to perform nearly as good as CNN network. This makes sense because of the provided data's structure.

The CNN directory explores advanced techniques for predicting Well Oil Production Rates (WOPR) using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and traditional machine learning models. The ensemble learning approach, which incorporates CNN, LSTM, and three additional ML models, demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to standalone models.
