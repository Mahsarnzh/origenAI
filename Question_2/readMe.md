# PINNs for Lid Driven Cavity Flow using Navier Stokes Equations

I have used two methods for predicitng the velocities in x and y directions and pressure, in the firt method I used deepcde library and packages which are provided by the creator of PINNs method, Dr. George Karniadakis.
In the second method I created the PINNs method from scratch.
